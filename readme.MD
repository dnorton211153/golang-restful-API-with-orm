# Golang RESTful API w/ mux/gorm/MySQL

```
This is a simple example of a Golang RESTful API,
using the gorm ORM library and the gorilla/mux router.

Tested with Postman (http://localhost:8000/user route)

My first attempt using Golang!  Hello Daz Productions guys!

Using Repository Interface per Model (best DB migration practice),
thanks to suggestions from [Praveen](https://techinscribed.com/different-approaches-to-pass-database-connection-into-controllers-in-golang/).
